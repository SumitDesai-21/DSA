# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

## Overview
This is a Data Structures and Algorithms repository. It contains the implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C Programming language. Also, it contains every single assignment of my Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## Data Structures
1. **Array**
2. **Linked List**
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Linked List  
3. **Stack**
    - Stack using Array
    - Stack using Linked List
4. **Queue**
    - Queue using Array
    - Queue using Linked List
5. **Infix-Postfix*
   - infix to postfix using arrays
   - postfix expression evaluation

## How to use this repository?
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SumitDesai-21/DSA
```
2. Change the directory to the required data structure or algorithm folder.
for example, to change the directory to circular linked list, use the following command:
```bash
cd linkedlist
cd cll
```
3. Compile the code using the following command:
```bash
gcc *.c -o output
```
4. Run the code using the following command:
